# Project: binary_search_tree
Project: Binary Search Tree from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees)

## Learnings
During this project, I learned how to create a binary search tree and develop functions to access and modify nodes (#insert, #delete, #find), traverse the tree (#level_order, #inorder, #preorder, #postorder), and provide node and tree attributes (#height, #depth). I also learned how to #balance? and #rebalance the tree.
